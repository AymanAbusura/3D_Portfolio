During this time, I have mastered and successfully applied technologies such as React, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, as well as libraries and frameworks like Vite, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I have worked on projects ranging from creating complex landing pages and e-commerce platforms to social applications, which has significantly strengthened my skills in UI/UX and API integration. Moving forward, I plan to deepen my expertise in building complex interfaces using modern approaches such as Server-side Rendering (SSR), while also progressing towards FullStack development with a focus on integrating React with microservices. I am open to Frontend Developer positions, primarily working with React, TypeScript, Redux, NextJS, and Vite.",
